### Technology Company Requirements

We've added a few restrictions to keep this a high-quality list:

 - **Technology**: The company's primary product or service must be an information technology product or service.
 - **Location**: The company must have some employees working in Manhattan, KS or the surrounding communities.

If your company meets the above requirements and you'd like to be added to the list, fork the repo, add your html/css (with your brand colors) and submit a pull request. If you don't want to create a pull request, you can also email bryce@flinthills.io with your companies information.
